# DNN / 2sxc Directory App using Angular 4

This is a fully functional angular app for DNN & 2sxc.

You can use it as is, modify it as you want or simply use it as inspiration, when learning Angular on DNN. 

## Installation
The app requires additional data, which is created when you install it in 2sxc. So to get started, you should

1. have DNN with 2sxc installed
1. install this app from the releases or the [app-catalog](https://2sxc.org/en/apps/app/directory-showcase-with-angular-4) (this will create a running, working app with data)

## Discover How It's Built

I'll write a blog-series about this some time...

## Modify As You Want
The full source code is included, so you can simply work with angular as you wish. We recommend using VS Code. Either way, you will usually...

1. run `npm install` from the main app folder to get all dependencies
1. run `npm watch` to continously build the solution while you change code
1. run `npm watchprod` to continously build the solution in production (AOT) code (smaller, etc.)
